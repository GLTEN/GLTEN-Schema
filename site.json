		"description": "The first experimental crop was harvested in 1844 after a rotation of turnips (dunged) 1839, barley 1840, peas 1841, wheat 1842 and oats 1843. The last four crops being entirely unmanured. The field was therefore considered to be exhausted according to contemporary practice.",
		"management": "The site is managed using conventional tillage and pesticide applications are applied as necessary, except for herbicide and fungicide exclusion plots.\n\nThe plough layer (0-23 m) is limed when necessary to maintain a minimum soil pH of 7.0 – 7.5."

The soils contain a large number of flints and are slightly calcareous. Below about 2m depth the soil becomes chalk. The experiment is under-drained and the site is free draining. There is considerable variation in soil texture across the site, with clay contents ranging from 19 – 39%"
